# TTKB
TTKB is my mod where I just add things that I feel like can't fit in anything else.

# Features
* Elevator - Jump to go to the elevator above, sneak to go to the elevator below. Also disguisable by right clicking it with any solid block.
* Activator - When given a redstone signal, the activator will right click on the block in front of it. Harvest berries, open doors, tune noteblocks. The possibilities are endless.
* Ender Hopper - Will pick up any item in the surrounding 5x5x5 area and put it into its internal inventory. It will also export this inventory to any connecting inventory block.
